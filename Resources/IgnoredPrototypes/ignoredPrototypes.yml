# This is a basic list that specifies files for which the prototypes inside of them will be made abstract.
# This supports all prototype kinds and is intended to allow servers to remove prototypes in a relatively clean way.
# This method does not break inheritance, but you will still have to remove usages.

# e.g., you can specify both directories and specific files by adding lines like:
#
# - /Prototypes/Guidebook
# - /Prototypes/Catalog/uplink_catalog.yml

 - /Prototypes/Access
#  - /Prototypes/lobbyscreens.yml
 - /Prototypes/radio_channels.yml
 - /Prototypes/round_announcements.yml
 - /Prototypes/SoundCollections/announcements.yml
# - /Prototypes/Entities/Objects/Consumable
# - /Prototypes/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Guns
# - /Prototypes/Entities/Objects/Weapons/Melee
